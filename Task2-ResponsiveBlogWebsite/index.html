                Fermented Foods and Gut Health: Fermented foods have been gaining popularity as people recognize the importance of gut health. Fermentation is a process that involves the breakdown of sugars in foods by bacteria or yeast, leading to the production of beneficial probiotics. Foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha are examples of fermented foods. They are known for their potential to improve digestion, boost the immune system, and support overall gut health.<br> As a result, there is a growing interest in incorporating fermented foods into daily diets, and many food companies are expanding their product lines to include fermented options. Additionally, home fermentation kits and workshops have become popular as people embrace the art of making their own fermented foods at home.
